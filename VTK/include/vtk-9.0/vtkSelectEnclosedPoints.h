/**
 * @class   vtkSelectEnclosedPoints
 * @brief   mark points as to whether they are inside a closed surface
 *
 * vtkSelectEnclosedPoints is a filter that evaluates all the input points to
 * determine whether they are in an enclosed surface. The filter produces a
 * (0,1) mask (in the form of a vtkDataArray) that indicates whether points
 * are outside (mask value=0) or inside (mask value=1) a provided surface.
 * (The name of the output vtkDataArray is "SelectedPoints".)
 *
 * After running the filter, it is possible to query it as to whether a point
 * is inside/outside by invoking the IsInside(ptId) method.
 *
 * @warning
 * The filter assumes that the surface is closed and manifold. A boolean flag
 * can be set to force the filter to first check whether this is true. If false,
 * all points will be marked outside. Note that if this check is not performed
 * and the surface is not closed, the results are undefined.
 *
 * @warning
 * This filter produces and output data array, but does not modify the input
 * dataset. If you wish to extract cells or points, various threshold filters
 * are available (i.e., threshold the output array). Also, see the filter
 * vtkExtractEnclosedPoints which operates on point clouds.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
