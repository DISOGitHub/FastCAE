/**
 * @class   vtkNew
 * @brief   Allocate and hold a VTK object.
 *
 * vtkNew is a class template that on construction allocates and
 * initializes an instance of its template argument using T::New().
 * It assumes ownership of one reference during its lifetime, and calls
 * T->Delete() on destruction.
 *
 * Automatic casting to raw pointer is available for convenience, but
 * users of this method should ensure that they do not
 * return this pointer if the vtkNew will go out of scope without
 * incrementing its reference count.
 *
 * vtkNew is a drop in replacement for vtkSmartPointer, for example,
 *
 * \code
 * vtkNew<vtkRenderer> ren;
 * vtkNew<vtkRenderWindow> renWin;
 * renWin->AddRenderer(ren);
 * vtkNew<vtkRenderWindowInteractor> iren;
 * iren->SetRenderWindow(renWin);
 * \endcode
 *
