/**
 * @class   vtkWidgetRepresentation
 * @brief   abstract class defines interface between the widget and widget representation classes
 *
 * This class is used to define the API for, and partially implement, a
 * representation for different types of widgets. Note that the widget
 * representation (i.e., subclasses of vtkWidgetRepresentation) are a type of
 * vtkProp; meaning that they can be associated with a vtkRenderer end
 * embedded in a scene like any other vtkActor. However,
 * vtkWidgetRepresentation also defines an API that enables it to be paired
 * with a subclass vtkAbstractWidget, meaning that it can be driven by a
 * widget, serving to represent the widget as the widget responds to
 * registered events.
 *
 * The API defined here should be regarded as a guideline for implementing
 * widgets and widget representations. Widget behavior is complex, as is the
 * way the representation responds to the registered widget events, so the API
 * may vary from widget to widget to reflect this complexity.
 *
 * @warning
 * The separation of the widget event handling and representation enables
 * users and developers to create new appearances for the widget. It also
 * facilitates parallel processing, where the client application handles
 * events, and remote representations of the widget are slaves to the
 * client (and do not handle events).

   * The following is a suggested API for widget representations. These methods
   * define the communication between the widget and its representation. These
   * methods are only suggestions because widgets take on so many different
   * forms that a universal API is not deemed practical. However, these methods
   * should be implemented when possible to insure that the VTK widget hierarchy
   * remains self-consistent.
   * <pre>
   * PlaceWidget() - given a bounding box (xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax), place
   * the widget inside of it. The current orientation of the widget
   * is preserved, only scaling and translation is performed.
   * StartWidgetInteraction() - generally corresponds to a initial event (e.g.,
   * mouse down) that starts the interaction process
   * with the widget.
   * WidgetInteraction() - invoked when an event causes the widget to change
   * appearance.
   * EndWidgetInteraction() - generally corresponds to a final event (e.g., mouse up)
   * and completes the interaction sequence.
   * ComputeInteractionState() - given (X,Y) display coordinates in a renderer, with a
   * possible flag that modifies the computation,
   * what is the state of the widget?
   * GetInteractionState() - return the current state of the widget. Note that the
   * value of "0" typically refers to "outside". The
   * interaction state is strictly a function of the
   * representation, and the widget/represent must agree
   * on what they mean.
   * Highlight() - turn on or off any highlights associated with the widget.
   * Highlights are generally turned on when the widget is selected.
   * </pre>
   * Note that subclasses may ignore some of these methods and implement their own
   * depending on the specifics of the widget.
