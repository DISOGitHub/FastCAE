/**
 * @class   vtkReaderAlgorithm
 * @brief   Superclass for readers that implement a simplified API.
 *
 * This class and associated subclasses were created to make it easier to
 * develop readers. When directly subclassing from other algorithm classes
 * one has to learn a general purpose API that somewhat obfuscates pipeline
 * functionality behind information keys. One has to know how to find
 * time and pieces requests using keys for example. Furthermore, these
 * classes together with specialized executives can implement common
 * reader functionality for things such as file series (for time and/or
 * partitions), caching, mapping time requests to indices etc.
 * This class implements the most basic API which is specialized as
 * needed by subclasses (for file series for example).
