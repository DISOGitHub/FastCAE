/**
 * @class   vtkMaskPointsFilter
 * @brief   extract points within an image/volume mask
 *
 * vtkMaskPointsFilter extracts points that are inside an image mask. The
 * image mask is a second input to the filter. Points that are inside a voxel
 * marked "inside" are copied to the output. The image mask can be generated
 * by vtkPointOccupancyFilter, with optional image processing steps performed
 * on the mask. Thus vtkPointOccupancyFilter and vtkMaskPointsFilter are
 * generally used together, with a pipeline of image processing algorithms
 * in between the two filters.
 *
 * Note also that this filter is a subclass of vtkPointCloudFilter which has
 * the ability to produce an output mask indicating which points were
 * selected for output. It also has an optional second output containing the
 * points that were masked out (i.e., outliers) during processing.
 *
 * Finally, the mask value indicating non-selection of points (i.e., the
 * empty value) may be specified. The second input, masking image, is
 * typically of type unsigned char so the empty value is of this type as
 * well.
 *
 * @warning
 * During processing, points not within the masking image/volume are
 * considered outside and never extracted.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
