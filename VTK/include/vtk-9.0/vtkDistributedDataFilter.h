/**
 * @class   vtkDistributedDataFilter
 * @brief   Serial stand-in for parallel filter that distributes data among processors
 *
 * This filter is a serial implementation of the vtkPDistributedDataFilter
 * filter with the intent that it can be used in non-MPI builds. This filter
 * acts almost as a "pass-through" filter when run in serial, though when the
 * input is a non-composite dataset, the output will be an vtkUnstructuredGrid
 * to be consistent with the parallel filter. The combination of this filter and
 * its parallel counterpart serves to unify the API for serial and parallel
 * builds.
