/**
 * @class   vtkReaderExecutive
 * @brief   Executive that works with vtkReaderAlgorithm and subclasses.
 *
 * vtkReaderExecutive is an executive that supports simplified API readers
 * that are written by subclassing from the vtkReaderAlgorithm hierarchy.
 * Currently, its main functionality is to call the basic reader API instead
 * if the standard ProcessRequest() method that other algorithms use.
 * In time, this is likely to add functionality such as caching. See
 * vtkReaderAlgorithm for the API.
 *
 * Note that this executive assumes that the reader has one output port.
