/**
 * @class   vtkStaticPointLocator2D
 * @brief   quickly locate points in 2-space
 *
 * vtkStaticPointLocator2D is a spatial search object to quickly locate points
 * in 2D.  vtkStaticPointLocator2D works by dividing a specified region of
 * space into a regular array of rectilinear buckets, and then keeping a
 * list of points that lie in each bucket. Typical operation involves giving
 * a position in 2D and finding the closest point; or finding the N closest
 * points. (Note that the more general vtkStaticPointLocator is available
 * for 3D operations.) Other specialized methods for 2D have also been provided.
 *
 * vtkStaticPointLocator2D is an accelerated version of vtkPointLocator. It is
 * threaded (via vtkSMPTools), and supports one-time static construction
 * (i.e., incremental point insertion is not supported). If you need to
 * incrementally insert points, use the vtkPointLocator or its kin to do so.
 *
 * Note that to satisfy the superclass's API, methods often assume a 3D point
 * is provided. However, only the x,y values are used for processing. The
 * z-value is only used to define location of the 2D plane.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class is templated. It may run slower than serial execution if the code
 * is not optimized during compilation. Build in Release or ReleaseWithDebugInfo.
 *
 * @warning
 * Make sure that you review the documentation for the superclasses
 * vtkAbstactPointLocator and vtkLocator. In particular the Automatic
 * data member can be used to automatically determine divisions based
 * on the average number of points per bucket.
 *
 * @warning
 * Other types of spatial locators have been developed such as octrees and
 * kd-trees. These are often more efficient for the operations described
 * here.
