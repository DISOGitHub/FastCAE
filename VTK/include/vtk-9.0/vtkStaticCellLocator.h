/**
 * @class   vtkStaticCellLocator
 * @brief   perform fast cell location operations
 *
 * vtkStaticCellLocator is a type of vtkAbstractCellLocator that accelerates
 * certain operations when performing spatial operations on cells. These
 * operations include finding a point that contains a cell, and intersecting
 * cells with a line.
 *
 * vtkStaticCellLocator is an accelerated version of vtkCellLocator. It is
 * threaded (via vtkSMPTools), and supports one-time static construction
 * (i.e., incremental cell insertion is not supported).
 *
 * @warning
 * This class is templated. It may run slower than serial execution if the code
 * is not optimized during compilation. Build in Release or ReleaseWithDebugInfo.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class *always* caches cell bounds.
