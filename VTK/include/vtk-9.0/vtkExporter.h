/**
 * @class   vtkExporter
 * @brief   abstract class to write a scene to a file
 *
 * vtkExporter is an abstract class that exports a scene to a file. It
 * is very similar to vtkWriter except that a writer only writes out
 * the geometric and topological data for an object, where an exporter
 * can write out material properties, lighting, camera parameters etc.
 * The concrete subclasses of this class may not write out all of this
 * information. For example vtkOBJExporter writes out Wavefront obj files
 * which do not include support for camera parameters.
 *
 * vtkExporter provides the convenience methods StartWrite() and EndWrite().
 * These methods are executed before and after execution of the Write()
 * method. You can also specify arguments to these methods.
 * This class defines SetInput and GetInput methods which take or return
 * a vtkRenderWindow.
 * @warning
 * Every subclass of vtkExporter must implement a WriteData() method.
 *
