/**
 * @class   vtk3DLinearGridCrinkleExtractor
 * @brief   fast extraction of cells intersected by a plane
 *
 * vtk3DLinearGridCrinkleExtractor is a specialized filter that, given a
 * specified implicit function, extracts unstructured grid cells that
 * intersect the implicit function. (Since the surface of these cells roughly
 * follows the implicit function but is "bumpy", it is referred to as a
 * "crinkle" suface.) This filter operates on vtkUnstructuredGrids consisting
 * of 3D linear cells: tetrahedra, hexahedra, voxels, pyramids, and/or
 * wedges. (The cells are linear in the sense that each cell edge is a
 * straight line.)  The filter is designed for high-speed, specialized
 * operation. All other cell types are skipped and produce no output.
 *
 * To use this filter you must specify an input unstructured grid or
 * vtkCompositeDataSet (containing unstructured grids) and an implicit
 * function to cut with.
 *
 * The RemoveUnusedPoints data member controls whether the filter remaps the
 * input points to the output. Since the algorithm simply extracts a subset
 * of the original data (points and cells), it is possible simply to pass the
 * input points to the output, which is much faster (factor of ~2X) then
 * mapping the input points to the output. Of course, not removing the unused
 * points means extra points in the output dataset, but because the input
 * points are shallow copied to the output, no additional memory is consumed.
 *
 * @warning
 * When the input is of type vtkCompositeDataSet the filter will process the
 * unstructured grid(s) contained in the composite data set. As a result the
 * output of this filter is then a vtkMultiBlockDataSet containing multiple
 * vtkUnstructuredGrids. When a vtkUnstructuredGrid is provided as input the
 * output is a single vtkUnstructuredGrid.
 *
 * @warning
 * Input cells that are not of 3D linear type (tetrahedron, hexahedron,
 * wedge, pyramid, and voxel) are simply skipped and not processed.
 *
 * @warning
 * The filter is templated on types of input and output points, and input
 * scalar type. To reduce object file bloat, only real points (float,double) are
 * processed.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
 *
 * @warning
 * The vtkExtractGeometry filter is similar to this filter when
 * ExtractOnlyBoundaryCells is enabled.
