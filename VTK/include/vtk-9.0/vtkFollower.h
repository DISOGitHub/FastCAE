/**
 * @class   vtkFollower
 * @brief   a subclass of actor that always faces the camera
 *
 * vtkFollower is a subclass of vtkActor that always follows its specified
 * camera. More specifically it will not change its position or scale,
 * but it will continually update its orientation so that it is right side
 * up and facing the camera. This is typically used for text labels in a
 * scene. All of the adjustments that can be made to an actor also will
 * take effect with a follower.  So, if you change the orientation of the
 * follower by 90 degrees, then it will follow the camera, but be off by
 * 90 degrees.
