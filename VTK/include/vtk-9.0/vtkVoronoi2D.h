 * @class   vtkVoronoi2D
 * @brief   create 2D Voronoi convex tiling of input points
 *
 * vtkVoronoi2D is a filter that constructs a 2D Voronoi tessellation of a
 * list of input points. The points are assumed to lie in a plane. These
 * points may be represented by any dataset of type vtkPointSet and
 * subclasses. The output of the filter is a polygonal dataset. Each output
 * cell is a convex polygon.
 *
 * The 2D Voronoi tessellation is a tiling of space, where each Voronoi tile
 * represents the region nearest to one of the input points. Voronoi
 * tessellations are important in computational geometry (and many other
 * fields), and are the dual of Delaunay triangulations.
 *
 * The input to this filter is a list of points specified in 3D, even though
 * the triangulation is 2D. Thus the triangulation is constructed in the x-y
 * plane, and the z coordinate is ignored (although carried through to the
 * output). If you desire to triangulate in a different plane, you can use
 * the vtkTransformFilter to transform the points into and out of the x-y
 * plane or you can specify a transform to vtkVoronoi2D directly.  In the
 * latter case, the input points are transformed, the transformed points are
 * triangulated, and the output will use the triangulated topology for the
 * original (non-transformed) points.  This avoids transforming the data back
 * as would be required when using the vtkTransformFilter method.  Specifying
 * a transform directly also allows any transform to be used: rigid,
 * non-rigid, non-invertible, etc.
 *
 * This filter is a reference implementation written with simplicity in
 * mind. Additional methods are available for debugging / instructional
 * purposes. This includes producing a single tile under various stages of
 * creation, as well as the Voronoi flower, related to the error metric for
 * point insertion / half-space clipping.
 *
 * Publications are in preparation to describe the algorithm. A brief summary
 * is as follows. In parallel, each (generating) input point is associated
 * with an initial Voronoi tile, which is simply the bounding box of the
 * point set. A locator is then used to identify nearby points: each neighbor
 * in turn generates a clipping line positioned halfway between the
 * generating point and the neighboring point, and orthogonal to the line
 * connecting them. Clips are readily performed by evaluationg the vertices
 * of the convex Voronoi tile as being on either side (inside,outside) of the
 * clip line. If two intersections of the Voronoi tile are found, the portion
 * of the tile "outside" the clip line is discarded, resulting in a new
 * convex, Voronoi tile. As each clip occurs, the Voronoi "Flower" error
 * metric (the union of error spheres) is compared to the extent of the
 * region containing the neighboring clip points. The clip region (along with
 * the points contained in it) is grown by careful expansion (e.g., outward
 * spiraling iterator over all candidate clip points). When the Voronoi
 * Flower is contained within the clip region, the algorithm terminates and
 * the Voronoi tile is output. Once complete, it is possible to construct the
 * Delaunay triangulation from the Voronoi tessellation. Note that
 * topological and geometric information is used to generate a valid
 * triangulation (e.g., merging points and validating topology).
 *
 * @warning
 * Coincident input points will result in overlapping tiles.  This is because
 * the Voronoi tessellation requires unique input points.
 *
 * @warning
 * This is a novel approach which implements an embarrassingly parallel
 * algorithm. At the core of the algorithm a locator is used to determine
 * points close to a specified position. A vtkStaticPointLocator2D is used
 * because it is both threaded (when constructed) and supports thread-safe
 * queries. While other locators could be used in principal, they must
 * support thread-safe operations.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
