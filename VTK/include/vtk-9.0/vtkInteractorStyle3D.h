/**
 * @class   vtkInteractorStyle3D
 * @brief   extends interaction to support 3D input
 *
 * vtkInteractorStyle3D allows the user to interact with (rotate,
 * pan, etc.) objects in the scene indendent of each other. It is designed
 * to use 3d positions and orientations instead of 2D.
 *
 * The following interactions are specified by default.
 *
 * A click and hold in 3D within the bounding box of a prop
 * will pick up that prop allowing you to translate and
 * orient that prop as desired with the 3D controller.
 *
 * Click/dragging two controllers and pulling them apart or
 * pushing them together will initial a scale gesture
 * that will scale the world larger or smaller.
 *
 * Click/dragging two controllers and translating them in the same
 * direction will translate the camera/world
 * pushing them together will initial a scale gesture
 * that will scale the world larger or smaller.
 *
 * If a controller is right clicked (push touchpad on Vive)
 * then it starts a fly motion where the camer moves in the
 * direction the controller is pointing. It moves at a speed
 * scaled by the position of your thumb on the trackpad.
 * Higher moves faster forward. Lower moves faster backwards.
 *
 * For the Vive left click is mapped to the trigger and right
 * click is mapped to pushing the trackpad down.
