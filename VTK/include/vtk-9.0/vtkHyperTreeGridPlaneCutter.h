/**
 * @class   vtkHyperTreeGridPlaneCutter
 * @brief   cut an hyper tree grid volume with
 * a plane and generate a polygonal cut surface.
 *
 *
 * vtkHyperTreeGridPlaneCutter is a filter that takes as input an hyper tree
 * grid and a single plane and generates the polygonal data intersection surface.
 * This cut is computed at the leaf cells of the hyper tree.
 * It is left as an option to decide whether the cut should be computed over
 * the original AMR mesh or over its dual; in the latter case, perfect
 * connectivity (i.e., mesh conformity in the FE sense) is achieved at the
 * cost of interpolation to the dual of the input AMR mesh, and therefore
 * of missing intersection plane pieces near the primal boundary.
