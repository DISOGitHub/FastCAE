//! Describes a parabola in the plane (2D space).
//! A parabola is defined by its focal length (that is, the
//! distance between its focus and apex) and positioned in
//! the plane with a coordinate system (a gp_Ax22d object) where:
//! -   the origin of the coordinate system is on the apex of
//! the parabola, and
//! -   the "X Axis" of the coordinate system is the axis of
//! symmetry; the parabola is on the positive side of this axis.
//! This coordinate system is the "local coordinate system"
//! of the parabola. Its orientation (direct or indirect sense)
//! gives an implicit orientation to the parabola.
//! In this coordinate system, the equation for the parabola is:
//! Y**2 = (2*P) * X.
//! where P, referred to as the parameter of the parabola, is
//! the distance between the focus and the directrix (P is
//! twice the focal length).
//! See Also
//! GCE2d_MakeParab2d which provides functions for
//! more complex parabola constructions
//! Geom2d_Parabola which provides additional functions
//! for constructing parabolas and works, in particular, with
//! the parametric equations of parabolas
