//! Construction of the section lines between two shapes.
//! For this Boolean operation, each face of the first
//! shape is intersected by each face of the second
//! shape. The resulting intersection edges are brought
//! together into a compound object, but not chained or
//! grouped into wires.
//! Computation of the intersection of two Shapes or Surfaces
//! The two parts involved in this Boolean operation may
//! be defined from geometric surfaces: the most common
//! use is the computation of the planar section of a shape.
//! A Section object provides the framework for:
//! - defining the shapes to be intersected, and the
//! computation options,
//! - implementing the construction algorithm, and
//! - consulting the result.
//! Example : giving two shapes S1,S2 accessing faces,
//! let compute the section edges R on S1,S2,
//! performing approximation on new curves,
//! performing PCurve on part 1 but not on part 2 :
//! Standard_Boolean PerformNow = Standard_False;
//! BRepBoolAPI_Section S(S1,S2,PerformNow);
//! S.ComputePCurveOn1(Standard_True);
//! S.Approximation(Standard_True);
//! S.Build();
//! TopoDS_Shape R = S.Shape();
//! On Null Shapes of geometries, NotDone() is called.

  //! This and the above algorithms construct a framework for computing the section lines of
  //! - the two shapes Sh1 and Sh2, or
  //! - the shape Sh and the plane Pl, or
  //! - the shape Sh and the surface Sf, or
  //! - the surface Sf and the shape Sh, or
  //! - the two surfaces Sf1 and Sf2,
  //! and builds the result if PerformNow equals true, its
  //! default value. If PerformNow equals false, the
  //! intersection will be computed later by the function Build.
  //! The constructed shape will be returned by the
  //! function Shape. This is a compound object
  //! composed of edges. These intersection edges may be built:
  //! - on new intersection lines, or
  //! - on coincident portions of edges in the two intersected shapes.
  //! These intersection edges are independent: they
  //! are not chained or grouped in wires.
  //! If no intersection edge exists, the result is an empty compound object.
  //! Note that other objects than TopoDS_Shape
  //! shapes involved in these syntaxes are converted
  //! into faces or shells before performing the
  //! computation of the intersection. A shape resulting
  //! from this conversion can be retrieved with the
  //! function Shape1 or Shape2.
  //! Parametric 2D curves on intersection edges
  //! No parametric 2D curve (pcurve) is defined for
  //! each elementary edge of the result. To attach such
  //! parametric curves to the constructed edges you
  //! may use a constructor with the PerformNow flag
  //! equal to false; then you use:
  //! - the function ComputePCurveOn1 to ask for the
  //! additional computation of a pcurve in the
  //! parametric space of the first shape,
  //! - the function ComputePCurveOn2 to ask for the
  //! additional computation of a pcurve in the
  //! parametric space of the second shape,
  //! - in the end, the function Build to construct the result.
  //! Note that as a result, pcurves will only be added on
  //! edges built on new intersection lines.
  //! Approximation of intersection edges
  //! The underlying 3D geometry attached to each
  //! elementary edge of the result is:
  //! - analytic where possible, provided the
  //! corresponding geometry corresponds to a type
  //! of analytic curve defined in the Geom package;
  //! for example, the intersection of a cylindrical
  //! shape with a plane gives an ellipse or a circle;
  //! - or elsewhere, given as a succession of points
  //! grouped together in a BSpline curve of degree 1.
  //! If you prefer to have an attached 3D geometry
  //! which is a BSpline approximation of the computed
  //! set of points on computed elementary intersection
  //! edges whose underlying geometry is not analytic,
  //! you may use a constructor with the PerformNow
  //! flag equal to false. Then you use:
  //! - the function Approximation to ask for this
  //! computation option, and
  //! - the function Build to construct the result.
  //! Note that as a result, approximations will only be
  //! computed on edges built on new intersection lines.
  //! Example
  //! You may also combine these computation options.
  //! In the following example:
  //! - each elementary edge of the computed
  //! intersection, built on a new intersection line,
  //! which does not correspond to an analytic Geom
  //! curve, will be approximated by a BSpline curve
  //! whose degree is not greater than 8.
  //! - each elementary edge built on a new intersection line, will have:
  //! - a pcurve in the parametric space of the shape S1,
  //! - no pcurve in the parametric space of the shape S2.
  //! // TopoDS_Shape S1 = ... , S2 = ... ;
  //! Standard_Boolean PerformNow = Standard_False;
  //! BRepAlgo_Section S ( S1, S2, PerformNow );
  //! S.ComputePCurveOn1 (Standard_True);
  //! S.Approximation (Standard_True);
  //! S.Build();
  //! TopoDS_Shape R = S.Shape();
  Standard_EXPORT BRepAlgo_Section(const Handle(Geom_Surface)& Sf1, const Handle(Geom_Surface)& Sf2, const Standard_Boolean PerformNow = Standard_True);

  Standard_EXPORT void Init2 (const TopoDS_Shape& S2);
  
  //! Initializes the second part
  Standard_EXPORT void Init2 (const gp_Pln& Pl);
  
  //! This and the above algorithms
  //! reinitialize the first and the second parts on which
  //! this algorithm is going to perform the intersection
  //! computation. This is done with either: the surface
  //! Sf, the plane Pl or the shape Sh.
  //! You use the function Build to construct the result.
  Standard_EXPORT void Init2 (const Handle(Geom_Surface)& Sf);
  
  //! Defines an option for computation of further
  //! intersections. This computation will be performed by
  //! the function Build in this framework.
  //! By default, the underlying 3D geometry attached to
  //! each elementary edge of the result of a computed intersection is:
  //! - analytic where possible, provided the
  //! corresponding geometry corresponds to a type of
  //! analytic curve defined in the Geom package; for
  //! example the intersection of a cylindrical shape with
  //! a plane gives an ellipse or a circle;
  //! - or elsewhere, given as a succession of points
  //! grouped together in a BSpline curve of degree 1. If
  //! Approx equals true, when further computations are
  //! performed in this framework with the function
  //! Build, these edges will have an attached 3D
  //! geometry which is a BSpline approximation of the
  //! computed set of points.
  //! Note that as a result, approximations will be computed
  //! on edges built only on new intersection lines.

  Standard_EXPORT void ComputePCurveOn1 (const Standard_Boolean B);
  
  //! Define options for the computation of further
  //! intersections which will be performed by the function
  //! Build in this framework.
  //! By default, no parametric 2D curve (pcurve) is defined
  //! for the elementary edges of the result.
  //! If ComputePCurve1 equals true, further computations
  //! performed in this framework with the function Build
  //! will attach an additional pcurve in the parametric
  //! space of the first shape to the constructed edges.
  //! If ComputePCurve2 equals true, the additional pcurve
  //! will be attached to the constructed edges in the
  //! parametric space of the second shape.
  //! These two functions may be used together.
  //! Note that as a result, pcurves will only be added onto
  //! edges built on new intersection lines.
  Standard_EXPORT void ComputePCurveOn2 (const Standard_Boolean B);
  
  //! Performs the computation of the section lines
  //! between the two parts defined at the time of
  //! construction of this framework or reinitialized with the
  //! Init1 and Init2 functions.
  //! The constructed shape will be returned by the function
  //! Shape. This is a compound object composed of
  //! edges. These intersection edges may be built:
  //! - on new intersection lines, or
  //! - on coincident portions of edges in the two intersected shapes.
  //! These intersection edges are independent: they are
  //! not chained or grouped into wires.
  //! If no intersection edge exists, the result is an empty compound object.
  //! The shapes involved in the construction of the section
  //! lines can be retrieved with the function Shape1 or
  //! Shape2. Note that other objects than
  //! TopoDS_Shape shapes given as arguments at the
  //! construction time of this framework, or to the Init1 or
  //! Init2 function, are converted into faces or shells
  //! before performing the computation of the intersection.
  //! Parametric 2D curves on intersection edges
  //! No parametric 2D curve (pcurve) is defined for the
  //! elementary edges of the result. To attach parametric
  //! curves like this to the constructed edges you have to use:
  //! - the function ComputePCurveOn1 to ask for the
  //! additional computation of a pcurve in the
  //! parametric space of the first shape,
  //! - the function ComputePCurveOn2 to ask for the
  //! additional computation of a pcurve in the
  //! parametric space of the second shape.
  //! This must be done before calling this function.
  //! Note that as a result, pcurves are added on edges
  //! built on new intersection lines only.
  //! Approximation of intersection edges
  //! The underlying 3D geometry attached to each
  //! elementary edge of the result is:
  //! - analytic where possible provided the corresponding
  //! geometry corresponds to a type of analytic curve
  //! defined in the Geom package; for example, the
  //! intersection of a cylindrical shape with a plane
  //! gives an ellipse or a circle; or
  //! - elsewhere, given as a succession of points grouped
  //! together in a BSpline curve of degree 1.
  //! If, on computed elementary intersection edges whose
  //! underlying geometry is not analytic, you prefer to
  //! have an attached 3D geometry which is a BSpline
  //! approximation of the computed set of points, you have
  //! to use the function Approximation to ask for this
  //! computation option before calling this function.
  //! You may also have combined these computation
  //! options: look at the example given above to illustrate
  //! the use of the constructors.
