//! Describes a plane.
//! A plane is positioned in space with a coordinate system
//! (a gp_Ax3 object), such that the plane is defined by the
//! origin, "X Direction" and "Y Direction" of this coordinate
//! system, which is the "local coordinate system" of the
//! plane. The "main Direction" of the coordinate system is a
//! vector normal to the plane. It gives the plane an implicit
//! orientation such that the plane is said to be "direct", if the
//! coordinate system is right-handed, or "indirect" in the other case.
//! Note: when a gp_Pln plane is converted into a
//! Geom_Plane plane, some implicit properties of its local
//! coordinate system are used explicitly:
//! -   its origin defines the origin of the two parameters of
//! the planar surface,
//! -   its implicit orientation is also that of the Geom_Plane.
//! See Also
//! gce_MakePln which provides functions for more complex
//! plane constructions
//! Geom_Plane which provides additional functions for
//! constructing planes and works, in particular, with the
//! parametric equations of planes
