//! Describes a line in 2D space.
//! A line is positioned in the plane with an axis (a gp_Ax2d
//! object) which gives the line its origin and unit vector. A
//! line and an axis are similar objects, thus, we can convert
//! one into the other.
//! A line provides direct access to the majority of the edit
//! and query functions available on its positioning axis. In
//! addition, however, a line has specific functions for
//! computing distances and positions.
//! See Also
//! GccAna and Geom2dGcc packages which provide
//! functions for constructing lines defined by geometric
//! constraints
//! gce_MakeLin2d which provides functions for more
//! complex line constructions
//! Geom2d_Line which provides additional functions for
//! constructing lines and works, in particular, with the
//! parametric equations of lines
