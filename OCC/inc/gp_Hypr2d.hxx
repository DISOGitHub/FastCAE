//! Describes a branch of a hyperbola in the plane (2D space).
//! A hyperbola is defined by its major and minor radii, and
//! positioned in the plane with a coordinate system (a
//! gp_Ax22d object) of which:
//! -   the origin is the center of the hyperbola,
//! -   the "X Direction" defines the major axis of the hyperbola, and
//! -   the "Y Direction" defines the minor axis of the hyperbola.
//! This coordinate system is the "local coordinate system"
//! of the hyperbola. The orientation of this coordinate
//! system (direct or indirect) gives an implicit orientation to
//! the hyperbola. In this coordinate system, the equation of
//! the hyperbola is:
//! X*X/(MajorRadius**2)-Y*Y/(MinorRadius**2) = 1.0
//! The branch of the hyperbola described is the one located
//! on the positive side of the major axis.
//! The following schema shows the plane of the hyperbola,
//! and in it, the respective positions of the three branches of
//! hyperbolas constructed with the functions OtherBranch,
//! ConjugateBranch1, and ConjugateBranch2:
//! ^YAxis

//! The major radius can be less than the minor radius.

//! gce_MakeHypr2d which provides functions for more
