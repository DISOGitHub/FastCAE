//! Describes an axis in the plane (2D space).
//! An axis is defined by:
//! -   its origin (also referred to as its "Location point"),   and
//! -   its unit vector (referred to as its "Direction").
//! An axis implicitly defines a direct, right-handed
//! coordinate system in 2D space by:
//! -   its origin,
//! - its "Direction" (giving the "X Direction" of the coordinate system), and
//! -   the unit vector normal to "Direction" (positive angle
//! measured in the trigonometric sense).
//! An axis is used:
//! -   to describe 2D geometric entities (for example, the
//! axis which defines angular coordinates on a circle).
//! It serves for the same purpose as the STEP function
//! "axis placement one axis", or
//! -   to define geometric transformations (axis of
//! symmetry, axis of rotation, and so on).
//! Note: to define a left-handed 2D coordinate system, use gp_Ax22d.
