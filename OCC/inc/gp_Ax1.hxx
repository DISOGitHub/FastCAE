//! Describes an axis in 3D space.
//! An axis is defined by:
//! -   its origin (also referred to as its "Location point"), and
//! -   its unit vector (referred to as its "Direction" or "main   Direction").
//! An axis is used:
//! -   to describe 3D geometric entities (for example, the
//! axis of a revolution entity). It serves the same purpose
//! as the STEP function "axis placement one axis", or
//! -   to define geometric transformations (axis of
//! symmetry, axis of rotation, and so on).
//! For example, this entity can be used to locate a geometric entity
//! or to define a symmetry axis.
