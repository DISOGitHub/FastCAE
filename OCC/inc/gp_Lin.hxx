//! Describes a line in 3D space.
//! A line is positioned in space with an axis (a gp_Ax1
//! object) which gives it an origin and a unit vector.
//! A line and an axis are similar objects, thus, we can
//! convert one into the other. A line provides direct access
//! to the majority of the edit and query functions available
//! on its positioning axis. In addition, however, a line has
//! specific functions for computing distances and positions.
//! See Also
//! gce_MakeLin which provides functions for more complex
//! line constructions
//! Geom_Line which provides additional functions for
//! constructing lines and works, in particular, with the
//! parametric equations of lines
