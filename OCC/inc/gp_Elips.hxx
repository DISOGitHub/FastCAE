//! Describes an ellipse in 3D space.
//! An ellipse is defined by its major and minor radii and
//! positioned in space with a coordinate system (a gp_Ax2 object) as follows:
//! -   the origin of the coordinate system is the center of the ellipse,
//! -   its "X Direction" defines the major axis of the ellipse, and
//! - its "Y Direction" defines the minor axis of the ellipse.
//! Together, the origin, "X Direction" and "Y Direction" of
//! this coordinate system define the plane of the ellipse.
//! This coordinate system is the "local coordinate system"
//! of the ellipse. In this coordinate system, the equation of
//! the ellipse is:
//! X*X / (MajorRadius**2) + Y*Y / (MinorRadius**2) = 1.0
//! The "main Direction" of the local coordinate system gives
//! the normal vector to the plane of the ellipse. This vector
//! gives an implicit orientation to the ellipse (definition of the
//! trigonometric sense). We refer to the "main Axis" of the
//! local coordinate system as the "Axis" of the ellipse.
//! See Also
//! gce_MakeElips which provides functions for more
//! complex ellipse constructions
//! Geom_Ellipse which provides additional functions for
//! constructing ellipses and works, in particular, with the
//! parametric equations of ellipses
