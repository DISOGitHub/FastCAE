//! Describes a right-handed coordinate system in 3D space.
//! A coordinate system is defined by:
//! -   its origin (also referred to as its "Location point"), and
//! -   three orthogonal unit vectors, termed respectively the
//! "X Direction", the "Y Direction" and the "Direction" (also
//! referred to as the "main Direction").
//! The "Direction" of the coordinate system is called its
//! "main Direction" because whenever this unit vector is
//! modified, the "X Direction" and the "Y Direction" are
//! recomputed. However, when we modify either the "X
//! Direction" or the "Y Direction", "Direction" is not modified.
//! The "main Direction" is also the "Z Direction".
//! Since an Ax2 coordinate system is right-handed, its
//! "main Direction" is always equal to the cross product of
//! its "X Direction" and "Y Direction". (To define a
//! left-handed coordinate system, use gp_Ax3.)
//! A coordinate system is used:
//! -   to describe geometric entities, in particular to position
//! them. The local coordinate system of a geometric
//! entity serves the same purpose as the STEP function
//! "axis placement two axes", or
//! -   to define geometric transformations.
//! Note: we refer to the "X Axis", "Y Axis" and "Z Axis",
//! respectively, as to axes having:
//! - the origin of the coordinate system as their origin, and
//! -   the unit vectors "X Direction", "Y Direction" and "main
//! Direction", respectively, as their unit vectors.
//! The "Z Axis" is also the "main Axis".
