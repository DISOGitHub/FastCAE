//! Describes an ellipse in the plane (2D space).
//! An ellipse is defined by its major and minor radii and
//! positioned in the plane with a coordinate system (a
//! gp_Ax22d object) as follows:
//! -   the origin of the coordinate system is the center of the ellipse,
//! -   its "X Direction" defines the major axis of the ellipse, and
//! -   its "Y Direction" defines the minor axis of the ellipse.
//! This coordinate system is the "local coordinate system"
//! of the ellipse. Its orientation (direct or indirect) gives an
//! implicit orientation to the ellipse. In this coordinate
//! system, the equation of the ellipse is:
//! X*X / (MajorRadius**2) + Y*Y / (MinorRadius**2) = 1.0
//! See Also
//! gce_MakeElips2d which provides functions for more
//! complex ellipse constructions
//! Geom2d_Ellipse which provides additional functions for
//! constructing ellipses and works, in particular, with the
//! parametric equations of ellipses
