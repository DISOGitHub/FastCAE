//! Describes a parabola in 3D space.
//! A parabola is defined by its focal length (that is, the
//! distance between its focus and apex) and positioned in
//! space with a coordinate system (a gp_Ax2 object)
//! where:
//! -   the origin of the coordinate system is on the apex of
//! the parabola,
//! -   the "X Axis" of the coordinate system is the axis of
//! symmetry; the parabola is on the positive side of this axis, and
//! -   the origin, "X Direction" and "Y Direction" of the
//! coordinate system define the plane of the parabola.
//! The equation of the parabola in this coordinate system,
//! which is the "local coordinate system" of the parabola, is:
//! Y**2 = (2*P) * X.
//! where P, referred to as the parameter of the parabola, is
//! the distance between the focus and the directrix (P is
//! twice the focal length).
//! The "main Direction" of the local coordinate system gives
//! the normal vector to the plane of the parabola.
//! See Also
//! gce_MakeParab which provides functions for more
//! complex parabola constructions
//! Geom_Parabola which provides additional functions for
//! constructing parabolas and works, in particular, with the
//! parametric equations of parabolas
