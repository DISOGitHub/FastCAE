//! A groundwork to convert a shape to data which complies
//! with a particular norm. This data can be that of a whole
//! model or that of a specific list of entities in the model.
//! You specify the list using a single selection or a
//! combination of selections. A selection is an operator which
//! computes a list of entities from a list given in input. To
//! specify the input, you can use:
//! - A predefined selection such as "xst-transferrable-roots"
//! - A filter based on a  signature.
//! A signature is an operator which returns a string from an
//! entity according to its type.
//! For example:
//! - "xst-type" (CDL)
//! - "iges-level"
//! - "step-type".
//! A filter can be based on a signature by giving a value to
//! be matched by the string returned. For example,
//! "xst-type(Curve)".
//! If no list is specified, the selection computes its list of
//! entities from the whole model. To use this class, you have to
//! initialize the transfer norm first, as shown in the example below.
//! Example:
//! Control_Reader reader;
//! IFSelect_ReturnStatus status = reader.ReadFile (filename.);
//! When using IGESControl_Reader or STEPControl_Reader - as the
//! above example shows - the reader initializes the norm directly.
//! Note that loading the file only stores the data. It does
//! not translate this data. Shapes are accumulated by
//! successive transfers. The last shape is cleared by:
//! - ClearShapes which allows you to handle a new batch
//! - TransferRoots which restarts the list of shapes from scratch.
