//! Describes a branch of a hyperbola in 3D space.
//! A hyperbola is defined by its major and minor radii and
//! positioned in space with a coordinate system (a gp_Ax2
//! object) of which:
//! -   the origin is the center of the hyperbola,
//! -   the "X Direction" defines the major axis of the
//! hyperbola, and
//! - the "Y Direction" defines the minor axis of the hyperbola.
//! The origin, "X Direction" and "Y Direction" of this
//! coordinate system together define the plane of the
//! hyperbola. This coordinate system is the "local
//! coordinate system" of the hyperbola. In this coordinate
//! system, the equation of the hyperbola is:
//! X*X/(MajorRadius**2)-Y*Y/(MinorRadius**2) = 1.0
//! The branch of the hyperbola described is the one located
//! on the positive side of the major axis.
//! The "main Direction" of the local coordinate system is a
//! normal vector to the plane of the hyperbola. This vector
//! gives an implicit orientation to the hyperbola. We refer to
//! the "main Axis" of the local coordinate system as the
//! "Axis" of the hyperbola.
//! The following schema shows the plane of the hyperbola,
//! and in it, the respective positions of the three branches of
//! hyperbolas constructed with the functions OtherBranch,
//! ConjugateBranch1, and ConjugateBranch2:
//!
//! ^YAxis

//! FirstConjugateBranch

//! Warning
//! The major radius can be less than the minor radius.
//! See Also
//! gce_MakeHypr which provides functions for more
//! complex hyperbola constructions
//! Geom_Hyperbola which provides additional functions for
//! constructing hyperbolas and works, in particular, with the
